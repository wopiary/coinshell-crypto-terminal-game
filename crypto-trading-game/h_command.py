Welcome to Coin$hell

As you might have observed, Coin$hell does not support other stuff, only on the VSCode terminal. 
I made this for the sole purpose of being easier to use.

Nothing really much to teach here, controls are not complicated. 
Just click/type, that's about it. Go on ahead and gamblâ€” trade!
